I am not sure whether I am sweating because of a stomach bug from the slug trail or fras on a strawberry I ate yesterday, or the Covid-19 virus that I might have picked up from any number of fellow transiters. I sit in a beautifully lit apartment overlooking the harbour in a quite residential area. Wrinkley brown couples can be seen rocking through the streets with matching beige outfits, and seagul cries can be heard echoing off the neighbouring highrises. As my eyeballs feel like dry sockets in need of a good dose of oil. I contomplate the fragility of life and the constant flux that we experience on this ever-so-thin skin that occupies all our existance. I feel inspired by the words of Jeremy Howard -- co-founder of fast.ai with his partner Rachel Thomas. Inspired to shake things up and challenge myself. After far too long in the confines of grey particle board rooms, trying to (or more often not) live up to seemingly arbitrary &quot;Learning Outcomes&quot;, it is time for some change. One would have thought that after hundreds of years school and formal teaching might have changed given the immense change that the human world has undergone. Sadly it hasn't, and the world is on track to wave fairwell to it's crawling mites that call it home. What capacity does a mite have to make any difference.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fastpages Notebook Blog Post</title><link href="https://joshua-larsen.com/joshua_larsen/jupyter/2020/02/20/test.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fastpages Notebook Blog Post" /><published>2020-02-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-02-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://joshua-larsen.com/joshua_larsen/jupyter/2020/02/20/test</id><author><name></name></author><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://joshua-larsen.com/joshua_larsen/images/chart-preview.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://joshua-larsen.com/joshua_larsen/images/chart-preview.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">An Example Markdown Post</title><link href="https://joshua-larsen.com/joshua_larsen/markdown/2020/01/14/test-markdown-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="An Example Markdown Post" /><published>2020-01-14T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-01-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://joshua-larsen.com/joshua_larsen/markdown/2020/01/14/test-markdown-post</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html">Example Markdown Post</summary></entry></feed>
